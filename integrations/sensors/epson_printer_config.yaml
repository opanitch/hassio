# ALTERNATIVES:

#    Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)
#    - Provides printer status and ink levels for compatible printers
#
# 2. Use SNMP integration if your printer supports it
#
# 3. Check HACS for community alternatives like "Epson Printer" integration
