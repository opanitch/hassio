# Harmony Remote Template Switches - DISABLED
# 
# ⚠️ NOTE: Logitech Harmony has been discontinued.
# If you still use Harmony, the template switch syntax below uses
# the legacy format. Modern template switches should be defined
# under the 'template:' integration.
#
# If you no longer use Harmony, this file can be deleted.
