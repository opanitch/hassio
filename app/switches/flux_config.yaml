# Flux Light Color Temp Integration - DEPRECATED
# https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/flux/
#
# ⚠️ MIGRATION REQUIRED:
# The Flux integration is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
# 
# RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT:
# Install "Adaptive Lighting" via HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
# https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting
#
# Adaptive Lighting provides:
# - Automatic color temperature adjustment based on time of day
# - Sleep mode for nighttime
# - Per-light configuration
# - Much more granular control
#
# To migrate:
# 1. Install HACS if not already installed
# 2. Search for "Adaptive Lighting" in HACS
# 3. Install and restart Home Assistant
# 4. Configure via Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > Adaptive Lighting
# 5. Add the lights listed below to your Adaptive Lighting configuration
# 6. Delete this file once migration is complete
