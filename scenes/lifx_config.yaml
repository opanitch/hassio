# LIFX Cloud Scenes - DEPRECATED
# https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/lifx_cloud/
#
# ⚠️ MIGRATION REQUIRED:
# The lifx_cloud platform is deprecated and will be removed.
#
# RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT:
# 1. Use the native LIFX integration (configured via UI)
#    Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > LIFX
# 2. Create scenes directly in Home Assistant using the Scene editor
#    Settings > Automations & Scenes > Scenes > Create Scene
#
# The native LIFX integration provides:
# - Local control (no cloud dependency)
# - Better reliability
# - Full feature support
###

# LEGACY CONFIG - COMMENTED OUT (deprecated)
# - platform: lifx_cloud
#   token: !secret lifx_api_token

# Empty list placeholder to prevent YAML errors with !include_dir_merge_list
